PHORCYS (Model "B") dissolved oxygen data from Iselin dock (WHOI) test well deployment in November 2016. 

Data are from three Aanderaa Model 4531 Aqua Oxygen Optodes (note these are not same optodes as used in the Model "A" PHORCYS).

Questions: Jamie Collins, james.r.collins@aya.yale.edu; Paul Fucile, pfucile@whoi.edu; Ben Van Mooy, bvanmooy@whoi.edu

Each data string is four lines long (T, A, B, C):

Field descriptions:

T: Field metadata

Local date, local time, end cap temp. (deg C), supply voltage, chamber status (0 = open, 1 = closed), irradiance (from sensor; arbitrary units)

A: Clear (transparent) chamber (432)
B: Opaque (dark) chamber (433)
C: Ambient oxygen outside of chambers (434)

4531 serial no., micromolar oxygen, percent saturation, temperature (deg. C), phase
