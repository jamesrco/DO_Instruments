Calliope Data Files
September 2, 2008

General considerations - The Calliope system does not normally log all the data available or all the data it obtains and uses internally; it logs a subset on a timed basis individually specified for each data item.  Data is frequently obtained and used for calculations without being logged due to a difference between the data collection interval and the log cycle.  If the log file recording rate was not the same as the data collection rate, post-processing calculations may not give the same answers as the originals even though all calculations are done correctly.  This is because the original calculations would have new data available at the collection rate whereas post-processing would only have the logged data subset.

The true wind calculation provides a good example; determining true wind speed and direction requires the wind sensor data plus heading from a compass or gyro and COG and SOG from a GPS.  Normally heading data is obtained at a rapid rate compared to wind data but they are both recorded at about the same interval.  This means that when the Calliope code makes the true wind calculation it is likely to use newly obtained heading data, which may not be logged.  Clearly, attempting to check the Calliope calculations using the logged data will be difficult but, if the logging rates have been chosen reasonably, post-processing will provide valid, useful results.

Log Files - The Calliope system generates data files of two types: 1) asynchronous, single-item-per-line, time stamped ASCII and 2) synchronous, multi-item-per-line, comma delimited (CSV).  A single file of the first type is always created containing data items logged at the time interval specified by the Calliope configuration.  Each line starts with a data identifier followed by the date and time given in the form used by Visual Basic (number of days since Dec. 31, 1899; the 31st is day #1) and then the time in normal human readable form.  These values are followed by the data terminated with a <cr><lf>.  Log files are normally created at midnight GMT and the name of the file provides ship and creation date information with a .dat extension.  The date value within the file name is always based on GMT.  The first line of the file provides ship, date and initialization local time information. The second line indicates the local time zone and the third provides a reminder that Calliope data timestamps are always GMT.  This is followed by a line containing **** indicating the start of recorded data.

The Calliope data collection application always uses GMT timestamp values regardless of the time zone setting of the application computer.  However, the start time for new data files is controlled by an entry in the configuration file. Regardless of when a file is started, the date information used to construct the file name is based on GMT.  Note however that any date and time information included in the data file headers is local time. If date or time values are included in data files as logged values, these will also be local values (with GMT timestamps). Time values are handled in this manner to allow more convenient use of local time for controlling Calliopes activities if desired. As an example, starting new files at a particular local time can be preferable to midnight GMT when instrumentation deployment activities are scheduled on a consistant local time basis. Note that GMT will be used exclusively if the computers time is set to GMT.

All lines after the headers **** contain data as shown in the following example taken from an Oceanus file named OC020915.dat.  For this example, most items are being logged at 1-minute intervals; HEHDT, PKEL99, Salinity, and SSV are exceptions. The header indicates that the Calliope computer was set to Azores Standard Time, which is one hour behind GMT. The file was started at approximately midnight local time and the timestamps reflect the 1 hour difference between local and GMT.

Note that the GPS data in the above example contains line-formatting characters that are not normally present in the real data files.  The GPS data item above was defined as four NMEA sentences and the Calliope program concatenates multi-line data, replacing line termination characters with commas.  <cr><lf> characters are only present at the end of each data item.

The CSV format file uses the same naming convention except that an underscore and two-digit number follow the date/time. The extension is always csv. CSV files are normally started at midnight GMT but the start time can be delayed by an amount specified in the configuration file. CSV files begin with a header line that identifies the ship and a line that identifies the data items in each of the following comma delimited columns.  The last item in this second line is always the header lines checksum.  The content of these files can be changed by a number of methods and if this is done, a new file is created having a new file name; the two-digit number following the underscore is incremented. The header line identifying the files data items is also corrected.

The rate at which data is added to a CSV file is normally once per minute but this can be changed by an entry in the Calliope configuration file.  Each line begins with a date and GMT time stamp and contains the most recent data available at the time of the entry.  Data is not repeated; if new data is not available when a line is to be added, the corresponding column is left blank.  The final item in each line is the checksum of the data identifier header line - not the data lines checksum.  This is included so that when data lines of this type are  broadcast to other applications, it is possible for these applications to determine if the correct header is being used.  The following is an example taken from the file OC020915_00.csv.

Special Files - A Calliope file entry transaction definition can define special files having a specified name and data content.  The data format will be as described above for the asynchronous .dat file.  Files of this type are generally used to record a limited amount of data, possibly triggered by an event of some nature. 

Raw Data Files - The Calliope data input code can be configured to time stamp (GMT) and log all data received on a particular port. The same file name can be specified for more than one port allowing a single raw data file to hold a number of different data items.  Raw data file names are specified when the files are activated; Calliope appends the yymmdd date and will always use a ".dat" extension (i.e. Pitch_080415.dat).

Metadata

The Calliope system generates a metadata file (Metadata.txt - possibly this file).  This is a simple text file containing information on the various data sources listed by sensor name and the designator used in the header information of the primary data file types.  The file also lists the constants defined by files in the Constants directory (i.e. calibration constants) and includes a copy of the file Metadata2.txt (located in the Calliope/Metadata directory), which can contain addition information entered by the application user. Hopefully, the resulting Metadata file contains enough information to make effective use of the data contained in the other files (i.e. format, units, sensor type, calibration dates, etc.).

In addition, there may be a second metadata file in the primary data directory named MetaDataAux.txt.  This file is intended to provide a location for initialization and other functions to store useful but non-data information obtained from sensor interrogations (such as the calibration date of an IMET sensor).  

Timestamp formats
 
The Calliope data collection application always uses GMT timestamp values regardless of the time zone setting of the application computer.  Also, the date used to generate the name of a data file is based on GMT. However, new files are not necessarily started at midnight GMT (file start times are controlled by an entry in the Calliope configuration file) and any date and time information included in data file headers is local time. If date or time values are included as logged values in data files, these will also be local values. The Calliope ".dat" data file headers indicate the local time zone setting when the file was started.     
 
Individual items in Calliope ".dat" data files are time stamped with two different formats. The first timestamp value is in the format used by Microsoft Visual Basic: the number of days since December 31, 1899 (Dec. 31 is day 1, not day 0).  Its primary purpose is to provide a continuously increasing date and time indicator for use in data graphing applications. The VB format facilitates this for some applications but converting the number to the normal human readable form can be painful. The second timestamp value (hh:mm:ss format) in combination with the date in the file header may eliminate the need for this conversion.  If not, the following may be helpful:
 
   00.00 is 00:00:00 on Dec. 30, 1899.
   00.50 is 12:00:00 (noon) on the same day.
   35390.58333 is 14:00:00 May 15, 1998.
