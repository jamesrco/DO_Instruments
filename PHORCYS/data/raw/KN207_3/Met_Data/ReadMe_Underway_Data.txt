
Calliope Data Notes for Knorr Cruise# kn207-03 / NAVICE / Kay Bidle:

22 June, 2012:

Underway Fluorometer and SBE45 sensors flushed with fresh water and 
Fluorometer cell cleaned as data showed 'greens growing' behavior, 
ie fluorometer data steadily rising.  

Data columns affected are: FLR, SBE45C, SBE45S, SBE45T, Salinity, SSCND
Data from these items should be considered faulty from 11:20am UTC 
until 12:35pm UTC on 22 June 2012, while waterflow was secured to these 
instruments for cleaning.


The SBE45 Underway Thermosalinograph has the following data column headers:
 SBE45C	 SBE45S	 SBE45T	 Salinity  SSCND
and the Underway Flourometer's data column header is:  FLR


26 April 2012 ~ 1220 - 1240 UTC   (During Ben Van Mooy's cruise, kn207-01)
Surface PAR tests done for Kim Thamatrakoln: took readings, covered sensor 
with double think window screen mesh, took readings.  Experiment repeated
with 'ocean blue' incubator covering.  Several data readings during this
time period will be artifically low.
